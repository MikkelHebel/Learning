# Bogo sort, also humorously known as "stupid sort," is a highly inefficient and random sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly shuffling
# the elements of an array randomly until the elements happen to be in sorted order by chance. Due to its random nature,
# it has an average-case time complexity that's practically unbounded and is not suitable for any serious sorting tasks.

# Big O Notation of Bogo Sort:
# O((n+1)!)

# Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides an array into two parts: the sorted portion and the unsorted portion.
# In each iteration, it selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and
# swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

# Big O Notation of Selection Sort:
# O(n^2)

# Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array into halves until
# each sub-array contains only one element.It then merges these sorted sub-arrays back together in a sorted manner.
# This process of dividing and merging continues until the entire array is sorted.

# Big O Notation of Merge Sort:
# O(n log n)
